    <figcaption> <b>fig:1.1 The Continental GT 650 alongside the Interceptor 650 was introduced in November 2017.
         The café racer has either a standard dual-seat or an optional solo seat with a seat hump. 
         The fuel tank is more angular than the roadster's. Clip-on handlebars and rear-set pegs allow a sportier riding position.
         The Royal Enfield ContinentalGT 650 is powered by a 647.95 cc, parallel-twin, air cooled and oil cooled engine.</b>
