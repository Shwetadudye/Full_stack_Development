## 🟡 Intermediate Practice (while loop)
1. Print the reverse of a given number (e.g., `123 → 321`).  
2. Print the sum of digits of a given number (e.g., `432 → 9`).  
3. Check if a given number is prime using loops.  
4. Print the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.  
5. Print all numbers between 1 and 200 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.  
6. Count how many digits are in a given number.  
7. Check if a number is a palindrome using loops (e.g., `121 → Palindrome`).  
8. Print the multiplication table of any number entered by the user.  
9. Find the largest digit in a given number.  
10. Find the smallest digit in a given number.
